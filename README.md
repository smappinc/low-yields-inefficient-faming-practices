# Dominic Muhairwe Project Solution.

Problem Statement: Low yields and inefficient farming practices by small-scale farmers in Uganda from a lack of appropriate
agricultural education.

Sub-problems:
1. Lack of awareness about modern farming techniques and practices.
2. Limited knowledge of modern post-harvest management.
3. Limited financial literacy and access to agricultural financing.

# Pseudocode Solutions

**Sub-Problem 1:** Lack of awareness about modern farming techniques and
practices

// a function that asks the farmer for information of his farm

function getFarmersInformation():

    // ask the farmer his name
    string farmersName = "Edward Yakinsuho"

    //show the farmer a list of types of farms and ask them to select one that is equal to theirs
    array categoryOfFarm[] = {"Rice Farming", "Poultry farming"}

    //store the farmers choice
    integer farmersChoice = "1"

// a function that shows the farmer demonstration farms 

function showDemonstrationFarms():

    // using the farmersChoice, show a relevant demonstration farm

    array demonstrationFarm[][] = {{"rice farm 1", "rice farm 2"},{"poultry farm1", poultry farm 2"}} 

    show demonstrationFarm[0][0] and show demonstrationFarm[0][1]


**Sub-Problem 2:** Limited knowledge of modern post-harvest management.

// a function to get information about farmers' crops

function getFarmersCropInformation():

    // ask the farmer to choose a crop they are harvesting from a list
    aray cropsList[] = {"Rice","Maize", "Coffee"}

    // store the farmers choice
    integer farmersChoice = "1"

// a function that shows best methods of harvest

function showBestHarvestingMethods():

    // an array that has the best methods of harvest for each crop
    array cropHarvest[][] = {{"Harvesting method for rice"},{"Harvesting method for Maize"}}

    // show the relevant harvesting methods according to the farmers choice
    show cropHarvest[0][0]


**Sub-Problem 3:** Limited financial literacy and access to agricultural financing.

// a function to get information about the farmers budget information

function getFarmersBudgetInformation():

    //get the farmers monthly budget
    farmersBudget = 500000

    //get the farmers monthly expenses
    farmersExpenditure = 250000

// a function that shows the farmer the best practices

function showBestPractices():

    bestPractices[] = {"best practice 1", "best practice 2"}
